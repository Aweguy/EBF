		Graveyard1: I've heard of mood lighting, but this is on another level.
		Graveyard2: If anything steals my loot I�ll smack 'em with a Seiken!
		Dungeon1: I'd love a good dungeon crawl... but all these boneheads won't stop attacking me!
		BloodMoon1: There are so many of them, can't we just sleep through this?
		BloodMoon2: I wanted to fish until this is over, but something stared at me underwater... Screw this, I'm out!
		Homeless1: You wouldn't happen to have a house, would you? Maybe with a free sofa?
		WindyDay1: Check it out! The wind is blowing enemies right into my sword!
		WindyDay2: Perfect weather to practice Tempest!
		Rain1: Come to think of it, I've never seen it rain at Hope Harbor.
		Rain2: Hey, how many raindrops do you think I can slice through? I'm trying to test my reflexes.
		Storm1: I wonder if my thunder swords can act as lightning rods...?
		Storm2: Even I'm not dumb enough to swing a big metal stick during this kind of weather!
		Day1: The sun is shining, the birds are singing... Time to get grinding for rare loot!
		Night1: Mmm... huh, night time? I'll get off my game soon, give me a minute or two.
		Night2: Man, nothing beats coming home from a quest with a fat sack of loot!
		Party1: Woo, party! Everyone�s going to love my Sandworm truffle barbecue!
		Normal1: I'm not a pirate, I am a Canadian of Piratical Descent.
		Normal2: Have you ever been to Hope Harbor? It's a nice place, especially at sunset.
		Normal3: Jeff? Who's Jeff?
		Normal4: This is a sword!
		Normal5: You can't be the main character on an empty stomach! Do you want anything?
		Normal6: It's not easy for me to find the code either!
		Hardmode1: I stumbled onto a few pirates recently. I wonder if they are holding on to something good.
		Corrupt1: This place should be for raiding, not sleeping! Get me out of here!
		Crimson1: This place should be for raiding, not sleeping! Get me out of here!
		Natalie1: I've known Natz for as long as I can remember. She's super reliable and smart!
		Lance1: Lance might be a crook, and a villain, and top 10 worst people I've ever met, but we're bros! Bros!
		Anna1: Anna's more than a little green when it comes to adventuring, but dang if she isn't good at trapping and hunting!
		NoLegs1: NoLegs is my best friend! We've been through thick and thin together!

		NoHome: I know people call me a homeless tramp, but is this actually what it's like not having a house? I don't think I'm a fan.
		FarFromHome: I think even Hope Harbor might be closer than my current digs.
		LoveSpace: I get to have all this space to myself? Sweet! Now I can keep all my stuff here!
		DislikeCrowded: This party's too big for me, I can't stash my loot anywhere.
		HateCrowded: It's so crowded there's no quiet spot for me to game in!
		LikeNPC_Princess: It's a ton of fun to play video games with {NPCName}! She keeps calling my Wii retro though...
		Princess_LovesNPC: Have you met Sir {NPCName}? Hehe, I decided to make him an honorary knight!
		DislikeBiome: There's nowhere to dock even a raft in the Desert...
		LikeBiome: Being by the Ocean makes me feel right at home!
		LoveNPC: Natz and I are like peanut butter and marshmallow fluff! There's no one I'd rather have around than her!
		LikeNPC: The stories {NPCName} tells always crack me up, they're great to have around for a feast!
		DislikeNPC: Natalie's one thing, but I can't make heads or tails of what {NPCName}'s saying!
		HateNPC: That {NPCName} keeps trying to tell me what to do. I just can't stand it!

		Graveyard1: Corpses make great target dummies!
		Graveyard2: …feels like home, in the most insulting way possible.
		Dungeon1: My scanner is acting up in this Dungeon! They're... they're coming through the walls! Through the goddamn walls!
		BloodMoon1: Where the heck are all these monsters coming from!? We didn't unleash another evil, did we?
		BloodMoon2: Ahhh! They’re coming! Fire! Fire everything!
		Homeless1: I can't be out in the field all day, I need a place to establish a base camp.
		WindyDay1: What a breeze today! Let’s go aerosailing!
		WindyDay2: I should've set up a wind farm. With this much wind blowing around, I'll have power for a week!
		Rain1: Not a fan of rain. I hate having to buy waterproofing for my prototypes.
		Rain2: I trudged through rain for nineteen days to hide in a muddy trench. A roof makes the weather much cozier.
		Storm1: Give me some lightning rods and I’ll add 1.21 jigawatts to our power grid.
		Storm2: Krakakoom!
		Day1: Blargh, daytime already? I need my morning energy drink.
		Night1: Sleep? Who needs sleep when you can have caffeine?
		Night2: Beware the men who speak in morse.
		Party1: This is great! I can finally stress test my camera's facial recognition technology on real people!
		Normal1: ...yes, I'll report back soon when I get some more findings. Over and out. ...what do you need?
		Normal2: Why do you people keep complaining about Air Strike?
		Normal3: Can I interest you in buying SpamCoin EX? We’re 70% funded, but the only backer is this maniacal puppet.
		Normal4: I’m amazed that being a villain has gotten me such a big fan club.
		Normal5: The secret behind Darkshot? Make the antimatter explode AFTER it hits the target.
		Normal6: You’re going mining? Today?! Bring an ocelot for safety.
		Hardmode1: Another day, another 8 to 10 hours of fieldwork and research.
		Corrupt1: This Corruption is like a warzone of rot and decay. It'd be interesting if the inhabitants weren't so bloodthirsty!
		Crimson1: This Crimson is like a warzone of gore and flesh. It'd be interesting if the inhabitants weren't so bloodthirsty!
		Matt1: Matt might be a total meathead, but I like his brute force approach to things.
		Natalie1: Hey, a word of advice about Natalie. If you see her holding an axe, run.
		Anna1: Anna's a naive forest girl, but I respect anyone who basically carries a hand cannon all day long.
		NoLegs1: The cat? He's a sneaky little gremlin, but I can tell he knows what's up.
		DownedNeonValk: NOOO!! My poor Valkyrie... You barbarian, if I didn't have the construction automated, I would charge you double! That being said, the parts are very expensive, so you better buy my wares.

		NoHome: Where am I supposed to set up my hacking station? The incoming AI invasion doesn't stop itself, you know.
		FarFromHome: Move my base or move the me. Both work in my book.
		LoveSpace: This area is the perfect location to set up a base of operations!
		DislikeCrowded: Too many people around, I can't concentrate on my research like this.
		HateCrowded: I can't test my tech with so many people nearby.
		LikeNPC_Princess: That {NPCName} girl has been a huge help with my research. I'm thinking of giving her a Flybot servant as thanks.
		Princess_LovesNPC: Lance may not have the best reputation, but I can tell his goals are noble indeed.
		DislikeBiome: I don't like the Ocean... Gunpowder won't ignite in water, and I'm surrounded by it.
		LikeBiome: These Mushrooms are perfect for researching new munitions!
		LoveNPC: I can't believe how much {NPCName} knows about pyrotechnics and explosives! She's incredible!
		LikeNPC: I know we argue a lot, but I like having {NPCName} around.
		DislikeNPC: I don't trust {NPCName}... he could be a double agent for the AI apocalypse, for all I know.
		HateNPC: There's something... off about that {NPCName} guy... I can't tell what, but he just gives me the creeps.

		Graveyard1: This place would be very peaceful if it wasn’t so creepy!
		Graveyard2: Better watch your soles. You never know if the dead will try sneak attacks from below us.
		Dungeon1: I bet I know a certain demon who would love this place... Me? Not so much!
		BloodMoon1: You shouldn't bug a hunter in a bad mood. Now leave me alone!
		BloodMoon2: Have you ever gutted a Mud Slime? You have to do it slowly or it'll burst and scald you. C'mere, I'll show you!
		Homeless1: It's pretty lonely not having anywhere to go back to.
		WindyDay1: I love this weather! It's a nice breeze from home.
		WindyDay2: The wind keeps blowing my arrows off course!
		Rain1: The trees just love this rain!
		Rain2: Time to get out my big galoshes!
		Storm1: Don't hide under trees if it's thundering! Lightning will take the path of least resistance to the ground: you!
		Storm2: When I said I wanted to try Spark Shower, this isn't what I meant!
		Day1: Remember, the early bird gets snagged by the early hunter!
		Night1: I like to take the evening to relax and care for my garden.
		Night2: Did you know that some plants only bloom at night? It seems strange to me too.
		Party1: Hey, want to watch me shoot a Pigronata blindfolded?
		Normal1: I’ve had the Fairy Bow the longest, but I have a good feeling about the Alchemist’s Bow.
		Normal2: Did we ever put the Sacred Jewels back? I can’t remember what happened after Godcat.
		Normal3: No, I’m not selling generic healing potions. Why would I be?
		Normal4: How does my new perfume smell? I asked Natz, but she just started blushing.
		Normal5: I used to make Wooden Idols as a kid, but Greenwood Village stopped doing that a while back.
		Normal6: What do you think of our sprites? I made them myself!
		Hardmode1: Yeesh! I went hunting in the Jungle and almost got run over by a Giant Tortoise!
		Corrupt1: This place is a crime against nature! If I knew any Fire skills I'd burn it down myself!
		Crimson1: This place is a crime against nature! If I knew any Fire skills I'd burn it down myself!
		Matt1: Matt's brain is small, so it can dodge arrows!
		Natalie1: Natalie says there are no cats with legs, but I could have sworn I saw a small yellow one the other day.
		Lance1: Listen, Lance is a bumhole, but he's our bumhole, alright? ...but if he tries anything, I'll tie him to the roof again.
		NoLegs1: Don't you think NoLegs is just adorable? At least, he's cuter than the wild cats I've seen around here.

		HateCrowded: Can I move somewhere quieter? I can't sleep with all the constant chatter.
		DislikeCrowded: I can't get any target practice in without worrying about someone getting in the way.
