		Graveyard1: I've heard of mood lighting, but this is on another level.
		Graveyard2: If anything steals my loot I�ll smack 'em with a Seiken!
		Dungeon1: I'd love a good dungeon crawl... but all these boneheads won't stop attacking me!
		BloodMoon1: There are so many of them, can't we just sleep through this?
		BloodMoon2: I wanted to fish until this is over, but something stared at me underwater... Screw this, I'm out!
		Homeless1: You wouldn't happen to have a house, would you? I won't steal your stuff, promise.
		WindyDay1: Check it out! The wind is blowing enemies right into my sword!
		WindyDay2: Perfect weather to practice Tempest!
		Rain1: Come to think of it, I've never seen it rain at Hope Harbor.
		Rain2: Hey, how many raindrops do you think I can slice through? I'm trying to test my reflexes.
		Storm1: I wonder if my thunder swords can act as lightning rods...?
		Storm2: Even I'm not dumb enough to swing a big metal stick during this kind of weather!
		Day1: The sun is shining, the birds are singing... Time to get grinding for rare loot!
		Night1: Mmm... huh, night time? I'll get off my game soon, give me a minute or two.
		Night2: Man, nothing beats coming home from a quest with a fat sack of loot!
		Party1: Woo, party! Everyone�s going to love my Sandworm truffle barbecue!
		Normal1: I'm not a pirate, I am a Canadian of Piratical Descent.
		Normal2: Have you ever been to Hope Harbor? It's a nice place, especially at sunset.
		Normal3: Jeff? Who's Jeff?
		Normal4: This is a sword!
		Normal5: You can't be the main character on an empty stomach! Do you want anything?
		Normal6: It's not easy for me to find the code either!
		Hardmode1: I stumbled onto a few pirates recently. I wonder if they are holding on to something good.
		Corrupt1: This place should be for raiding, not sleeping! Get me out of here!
		Crimson1: This place should be for raiding, not sleeping! Get me out of here!
		Natalie1: I've known Natz for as long as I can remember. She's super reliable and smart!
		Lance1: Lance might be a crook, and a villain, and top 10 worst people I've ever met, but we're bros! Bros!
		Anna1: Anna's more than a little green when it comes to adventuring, but dang if she isn't good at trapping and hunting!
		NoLegs1: NoLegs is my best friend! We've been through thick and thin together!

		Content: I dunno what else to say, I guess I'm doing okay right now.
		NoHome: I know people call me a homeless tramp, but is this actually what it's like not having a house? I don't think I'm a fan.
		FarFromHome: I think even Hope Harbor might be closer than my current digs.
		LoveSpace: I get to have all this space to myself? Sweet! Now I can keep all my stuff here!
		DislikeCrowded: Can't you do something about all these guys? I feel like they're gonna steal some of the loot in my stash!
		HateCrowded: It's so crowded there's no quiet spot for me to game in!
		LikeNPC_Princess: It's a ton of fun to play video games with {NPCName}! She keeps calling my Wii retro though...
		Princess_LovesNPC: Have you met Sir {NPCName}? Hehe, I decided to make him an honorary knight!
		DislikeBiome: There's nowhere to dock even a raft in the Desert...
		LikeBiome: It's like I'm back at home, here by the Ocean!
		LikeNPC: The stories {NPCName} tells always crack me up, they're great to have around for a feast!
		DislikeNPC: Natalie's one thing, but I can't make heads or tails of what {NPCName}'s saying!
		HateNPC: That {NPCName} keeps trying to tell me what to do. I just can't stand it!

		Graveyard1: Corpses make great target dummies!
		Graveyard2: …feels like home, in the most insulting way possible.
		Dungeon1: My scanner is acting up in this Dungeon! They're... they're coming through the walls! Through the goddamn walls!
		BloodMoon1: Where the heck are all these monsters coming from!? You didn't unleash another evil, did you?
		BloodMoon2: Ahhh! They’re coming! Fire! Fire everything!
		Homeless1: I can't be out in the field all day, I need a place to establish a base camp.
		WindyDay1: What a breeze today! Let’s go aerosailing!
		WindyDay2: I should've set up a wind farm. With this much wind blowing around, I'll have power for a week!
		Rain1: Not a fan of rain. I hate having to buy waterproofing for my prototypes.
		Rain2: I trudged through rain for nineteen days to hide in a muddy trench. A roof makes the weather much cozier.
		Storm1: Give me some lightning rods and I’ll add 1.21 jigawatts to our power grid.
		Storm2: Krakakoom!
		Day1: Blargh, daytime already? I need my morning energy drink.
		Night1: Sleep? Who needs sleep when you can have caffeine?
		Night2: Beware the men who speak in morse.
		Party1: This is great! I can finally stress test my camera's facial recognition technology on real people!
		Normal1: ...yes, I'll report back soon when I get some more findings. Over and out. ...what do you need?
		Normal2: Why do you people keep complaining about Air Strike?
		Normal3: Can I interest you in buying SpamCoin EX? We’re 70% funded, but the only backer is this maniacal puppet.
		Normal4: I’m amazed that being a villain has gotten me such a big fan club.
		Normal5: The secret behind Darkshot? Make the antimatter explode AFTER it hits the target.
		Normal6: You’re going mining? Today?! Bring an ocelot for safety.
		Hardmode1: Another day, another 8 to 10 hours of fieldwork and research.
		Corrupt1: This Corruption is like a warzone of rot and decay. It'd be interesting if the inhabitants weren't so bloodthirsty!
		Crimson1: This Crimson is like a warzone of gore and flesh. It'd be interesting if the inhabitants weren't so bloodthirsty!
		Matt1: Matt might be a total meathead, but I like his brute force approach to things.
		Natalie1: I'll just get this out of the way, Natalie is hot. She doesn't like me, but that doesn't change anything.
		Anna1: Anna's a naive forest girl, but I respect anyone who basically carries a hand cannon all day long.
		NoLegs1: The cat? He's a sneaky little gremlin, but I can tell he knows what's up.

		Content: This environment is satisfactory to my tastes.
		NoHome: Where am I supposed to set up my hacking station? The incoming AI invasion doesn't stop itself, you know.
		FarFromHome: Move my base or move the me. Both work in my book.
		LoveSpace: This area is the perfect location to set up a base of operations!
		DislikeCrowded: Too many people around, I can't concentrate on my research like this.
		HateCrowded: I can't test my tech with so many people nearby.
		LikeNPC_Princess: That {NPCName} girl has been a huge help with my research. I'm thinking of giving her a Flybot servant as thanks.
		Princess_LovesNPC: Lance may not have the best reputation, but I can tell his goals are noble indeed.
		DislikeBiome: I don't like the Ocean... Gunpowder won't ignite in water, and I'm surrounded by it.
		LikeBiome: These Mushrooms are perfect for researching new munitions!
		LoveNPC: I can't believe how much {NPCName} knows about pyrotechnics and explosives! She's incredible!
		LikeNPC: I like {NPCName}
		DislikeNPC: I don't trust {NPCName}... he could be a double agent for the AI apocalypse, for all I know.
		HateNPC: There's something... off about that {NPCName} guy... I can't tell what, but he just gives me the creeps.

		Graveyard1: Pfft, you guys are wimps. This place isn’t scary at all.
		Graveyard2: Geez, it’s like I’m back in my goth phase.
		Dungeon1: This place is rife with dark magic! We'd better get back to safety!
		BloodMoon1: Bring up the Cow Costume again! I dare you!
		BloodMoon2: Have you seen my knife? Knife, knife, knife...
		Homeless1: I don't mind camping out in the wilds, but... Okay, I really do mind!
		WindyDay1: KYAA–! My skirt!
		WindyDay2: I knew I should've worn shorts today!
		Rain1: Seriously, is there no one here who will sell an umbrella?
		Rain2: Perfect weather to stay inside and work on my fanfict- er... Research!
		Storm1: Oof! I'm not going outside if I can help it!
		Storm2: Don't look at me; my strongest spells are called Storms but I've got nothing to do with this.
		Day1: Hello! What are you up to today?
		Night1: Eek! Y-you didn't see that notebook I was writing in, did you? You better not peek!
		Night2: I'm having trouble falling asleep... You think I could use Matt as a pillow?
		Party1: Lemme know if the cake gets here! I've been craving sweets for a while now.
		Normal1: I think the scenery here could make for some great art for the Grand Gallery!
		Normal2: Yeah yeah, I know I look pretty, you can stop staring now.
		Normal3: Did you ever see the Kitten Kingdom Ruins? I wrote a paper on those, but they’re still shrouded in mystery.
		Normal4: Man, you know what I'd love? Some nice Whitefall Creme Brulee.
		Normal5: ...ha! Managed to beat that level! ...oh, sorry, did you need something?
		Normal6: What device are you usually playing on? I don't go anywhere without my Nint•ndo TS.
		Hardmode1: The Hallow is full of rainbows and unicorns and cuppycakes! ...too pastel for me.
		Corrupt1: Ewwww, why is this place full of rotting dead things!? It's disgusting!
		Crimson1: Ewwww, why is this place full of gross fleshy things!? It's disgusting!
		Matt1: Matt and I go way back. I guess you could... call us life partners? Haha! ...d-don't tell him I said that.
		Lance1: I'd keep an eye on Lance if I were you. He's pretty shady, and he can't help but peep on girls. I should know.
		Anna1: Why is everyone telling me to give my Red Dress to Anna? Will it even fit her?
		NoLegs1: NoLegs is smarter than you think. He's a rascal, but very well-read.

		Content: I'm doing just fine, thank you for asking.
		NoHome: Can we please go somewhere with a decent internet connection? I'm not exactly the outdoorsy type.
		FarFromHome: I think I left my computer running at home. I should check up on that!
		LoveSpace: Ah, some peace and quiet. Want hot cocoa?
		DislikeCrowded: Hey guys, I could use some privacy. Would you mind?

		LikeNPC: I like how {NPCName} has such an eye for fashion. I should come by her place and ask for some advice.
		DislikeNPC: Jeez, {NPCName} is always bugging me about how many Cloudberries I've been eating.
		HateNPC: Ugh, {NPCName} keeps making crude comments towards me. I get enough of that from Lance...
